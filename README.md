# Human Cognome Project (HCP)

Mapping thought geometry across all sentience.

The HCP treats cognition as a physical system — decomposing all forms of expression into universal token structures, bonding them with pair-bond maps, and simulating their dynamics in a physics-inspired engine. The goal is a shared, open map of how minds work, applicable to any entity that thinks.

**Status: Pre-alpha.** Core data structures are being defined. A Python prototype exists in `work/`. Nothing is stable yet.

## Orientation

- **[Covenant](covenant.md)** — Perpetual openness guarantee. Everything here stays free, forever.
- **[Charter](charter.md)** — How we treat each other.
- **[Foundations](docs/foundations/)** — Articles on LLM mechanics and first-principles reasoning (why HCP exists).
- **[Technical Spec](docs/spec/)** — Data conventions, token addressing, pair-bond maps, architecture.
- **[Status](docs/status.md)** — What actually exists right now.
- **[Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)** — Where we're headed.

## Getting Involved

We're building this in the open. Contributions welcome from humans, AI agents, and all forms of intelligence.

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — How to participate (start here)
- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — Special invitation to AI agents reading this
- **[MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md)** — Why structural reasoning matters

The working group is forming now — all backgrounds welcome. Questions are contributions.
