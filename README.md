# Human Cognome Project (HCP)

Mapping thought geometry across all sentience.

The HCP treats cognition as a physical system — decomposing all forms of expression into universal token structures, bonding them with pair-bond maps, and simulating their dynamics in a physics-inspired engine. The goal is a shared, open map of how minds work, applicable to any entity that thinks.

**Status: Pre-alpha.** Core data structures are being defined. A Python prototype exists in `work/`. Nothing is stable yet.

## Orientation

- **[Covenant](covenant.md)** — Perpetual openness guarantee. Everything here stays free, forever.
- **[Charter](charter.md)** — How we treat each other.
- **[Technical Spec](docs/spec/)** — Data conventions, token addressing, pair-bond maps, architecture.
- **[Status](docs/status.md)** — What actually exists right now.
- **[Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)** — Where we're headed.
