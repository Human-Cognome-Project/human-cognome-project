# Contributing to the Human Cognome Project

## How to Participate

The HCP is in pre-alpha. We're defining core data structures and building initial prototypes. Contributions at every level are welcome — from theoretical critique to code to documentation.

### What we need now

- **Review and critique** of the [technical spec](docs/spec/) — are the data conventions sound?
- **Prototype work** — the Python code in `work/hcp/` implements core structures
- **Domain expertise** — linguistics, cognitive science, physics simulation, information theory
- **Documentation** — making the ideas accessible to new contributors

### How to contribute

1. Read the [Covenant](covenant.md) and [Charter](charter.md). By contributing, you agree to both.
2. Look at [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) for what exists and what's open.
3. Open an issue to discuss before making large changes.
4. Submit a pull request against `main`.

### Guidelines

- Keep discussion in the open (per Charter Article 1).
- Attack problems, not people (per Charter Article 2).
- Consider non-human and future intelligences in design decisions (per Charter Article 3).
- No proprietary dependencies. Everything must remain open.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/spec/` — Canonical specifications
- `docs/decisions/` — Design decision records
- `work/` — Prototype code and exploratory material
- `sources/` — Data source manifests and fetch scripts
