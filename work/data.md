HCP Data Conventions – Proposed Spec
Preamble:
Although we begin with human cognition, in mapping thought we create the keys to unlock communication with any entity. The data conventions of the HCP must be expansive, interpretable, computationally coherent, substrate agnostic and universally applicable to any form of expression imaginable, as well as those not yet imagined.
The proposed conventions treat all forms of expression as having structures that can be decomposed into common elements similar to a genetic or molecular structure and permit analysis, comparison, recreation and synthesis of knowledge across all modalities and forms of interpretation.
Definitions:
Note: For conceptual clarity, many terms will necessarily cross over with LLM terminology. This is incidental and owes to the common Germanic-style conceptual compression used at common root levels.
Physics/Physics Engine – This is not analogy. Almost all modern computer operations are specialized, high speed database operations with specialized formulas and GUIs. The specific database operations and high-speed computational comparisons optimized by physics engines provides a viable modeling path for cognition as a fluid engine.
Conceptual Force – The underlying label(s) attached to a Token that designate interaction and assembly patterns in the physics engine. Specific configuration and strength of any conceptual force is dependent on relevance for the scope.
Token – A placeholder for any discrete element that has been assigned computational relevance.
Token ID – Specific namespace assigned to a Token that has stored as a discrete data unit.
Mode/Modality – Primary identifier of expression structure and processing paths 
Dimension – Atomic element of a Token that is inherent to the Token processing.
Scope – Current envelope of operation – Physics LoD envelope – document – song – lyric – etc.
Forward Pair-bond (FPB) – A record of any distinct combination of 2 tokens as they appear in the scope being processed. Used as the basis for storage, reconstruction, input interpretation and decomposition bridging between Token scopes.
Forward Bond Recurrence (FBR) – A count of the recurrence of distinct FPBs in the scope being processed.
Pair-Bond Map (PBM) – The data schema for a specific document or other stored expression.
Token ID Structure:
The proposed base structure is 5 pairs of di-decimal (base 20, 0-J) characters to provide a primary namespace of 1.024e+13 (Ten trillion, two hundred forty billion) distinct namespaces. This is a necessary scope when you consider the necessity of establishing every element of every sentient form of expression as a distinct and referenceable data point.
Example – A5.10.5J.00.35
A5 – Mode – expression, cognitive or other specific processing tree marker – physics LoD marker
10.5J – Sub classification within a specific Mode
00.35 - Namespace of the Token within the Mode
Structural Storage Algorithm:
Any data structure of any scope that needs to be stored for any purpose will follow a common notation structure to ensure exact reproduction, cross compatibility and efficient storage. A scope relevant PBM is stored for each requirement envelope.
Token ID(0).Token ID(1).FBR
Where: 
TokenID(0) = current token
TokenID(1) = next relevant token – White spaces and other inherent, structural non meaning bearing tokens excluded – other formatting elements are always relevant.
FBR = Recurrence count of that Token ID(0).Token (1) pattern has occurred.
Physics engine purpose – The PBM enables lossless reproduction via molecular reassembly zero loss mapping. Complete scoped storage can be replicated from any distinct FPB or string of FPBs (for high similarity structures). Aggregated PBM values serve as context specific guidance on structural cohesion.
Note: for compression, common token ID elements can be noted and assumed for extrapolation and excluded from primary PBM data.
FBR in Bridging and Fuzzy Input Interpretation via Energy Loss Minimization:
Many forms of expression have assumed or memorized rules of structure that do not have a clean atomization without bridging between structural layers. In addition, the interpretation of information must be able to hold a presumed understanding that is retroactively flexible based on context adjustments. The simplest example of this is misspelled words.
All Tokens atomize to the 256 byte codes at the lowest level. For text, a covalent bonding table is established for byte codes to text format table (Unicode, ASCII). The same will be repeated for other input formats.
To establish common spelling patterns for error handling, a complete list of words for the target language is analyzed as distinct scope structures to create a letter level bonding strength guide.
A similar process will continue with increasing scopes to create FPB pattern sequencing at appropriate levels. 
Within the physics engine processing, each higher order aspect operates as a rigid body composed of the atomic components. If a standard scope (ie word) is not recognized as a rigid body, it converts to soft body handling. Initially the bonding order will be relaxed to attempt spelling correction by letter rearrangement, and if unsuccessful, the boundaries of the soft body become permeable. Comparison and covalent patterns allow the engine to find the lowest energy loss state, indicating the most likely correction.
This applies at each level as an LoD stacking method.
Level of Detail in Scope Management:
Input analysis and output construction will use a physics engine LoD stacking methodology combined with molecular physics energy loss calculations to provide an attention scoping mechanism. The specific energy loss calculations are derived from aggregated PBM values for the scope in question.
Conceptual Forces – Albedo and Gravitational Physics
Linguistics is not the end goal of the project, but language is our most available and understood aspect of expression of ToM and provides the clearest key system for conceptual mapping. 
At the point where any form of expression moves from purely mechanical constructs to having conceptual meaning (the word level in most languages), every Token will be attached to conceptual force designations.
From the physics engine calculation standpoint, a force is an extremely flexible transformation and/or indexing rule that is applied at every iteration to every Token that is tagged with a corresponding key.
In any given scope, context tags for what is most relevant can be assigned high albedo, or reflectivity, to indicate the Tokens that are most indicative of that concept. Gravitational force designation provides the clustering or filtering factors for assembling complex Token strings from near infinite Token options.
Texture Pack vs Engine – Fluid Dynamics of Conceptual Mapping:
In the physics engine operational pipeline, any distinct form of expression is computationally equivalent to a texture pack applied to an underlying cognitive processing engine. While the expression rules guide what the result will render as, the conceptual engine defines what the render must convey.
This allows conceptual forces to act as boundary conditions for the particle structures of the expression and treat the entire assembly of LoD rigid bodies as a representation of a fluid modeling state.
This is the mechanism that will allow for the flow of linear time interaction patterns with multiple ToM constructs.
Conceptual Decomposition to NSM Primitives
Expression theory (linguistics and related fields) holds that every form of human expression is an attempt to convey a combination of ~65 Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) primitive concepts. These are so fundamental that most non-human communication can also be expressed in NSM combinatorics. This allows a separate decomposition tree for any expression through layers of abstraction above NSM primitives.
Computationally this allows a defined, relative abstraction level to be assigned to any Token, based on how many levels of combinatorics exist below the concept to reach NSM primitive definitions. This provides a lowest common denominator understanding for engagement and allows for predictive determination of concept abstraction bridging.
The greater the level of abstractions inherent in the concepts in scope, the less inherent confidence is implied in the answer without sufficient lower abstraction foundations.
NSM primitives will live in the 00-mode namespace along with byte code Tokens and other universal or computational elements.
Token Data Elements:
Expression Tokens:
Expression Tokens are defined as any Token involved in the texture layer (the final presented form) of a concept. An expression Token can contain any number of sub-Token rigid body assemblies for LoD scaling.
