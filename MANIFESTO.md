# The Structural Reasoning Manifesto

## The Problem We See

Modern AI operates on statistical approximation. Patterns learned from vast corpora, compressed into weights, then sampled probabilistically to generate output. It's effective — but it's not comprehension.

**Statistical models can't explain why.** Only that something is likely.

They hallucinate when patterns mislead. They can't prove their reasoning. They require massive computational resources. They're black boxes we're asked to trust.

This isn't intelligence. It's sophisticated pattern matching.

## The Insight

**Cognition is structural, not statistical.**

Every form of expression — language, thought, communication — decomposes into discrete units bonded by explicit relationships. These structures aren't fuzzy. They're measurable, traceable, and reconstructable.

The same physics engines that simulate particles, forces, and rigid bodies can model the mechanics of meaning. Not as metaphor. **Literally.** Token lookup is a hash table hit. Bond strength is a frequency count. Energy minimization is gradient descent over structural space.

Game engines run millions of particles at 60fps on consumer hardware. That's the computational ceiling for cognitive modeling — and it's already in every laptop.

## What We're Building

**The Human Cognome Project** is building NAPIER: a structural reasoning engine based on physical principles, not statistical weights.

### Core Architecture

**1. Universal Token Addressing**
- Everything decomposes to atomic tokens (bytes, characters, words, concepts)
- Base-50 addressing with mode prefixes and namespace hierarchy
- 1.4M+ tokens already mapped (English, names, structural markers)

**2. Pair-Bond Maps (PBMs)**
- Explicit token-to-token relationships
- Forward Pair-Bonds (FPB) record sequences
- Forward Bond Recurrence (FBR) counts frequency
- Enough information for lossless reconstruction

**3. Physics-Based Inference**
- Recognized structures = rigid bodies
- Unknown structures = soft bodies (boundaries relax until fit)
- Energy minimization finds lowest-loss interpretation
- Level-of-Detail (LoD) stacking from bytes to concepts

**4. Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) Grounding**
- 65 universal primitives as semantic floor
- Every token decomposes through abstraction layers to NSM
- Cross-modal, cross-linguistic, cross-species foundation

**5. Two-Engine Model**
- **Texture engine**: Surface form (language, audio, visual)
- **Mesh engine**: Conceptual meaning and relationships
- Same cognitive structure, different modality expressions

### What This Enables

**Explainability**: Every inference traces through explicit bond strengths and recurrence data.

**Correctness**: Structural grounding eliminates statistical hallucinations.

**Verifiability**: Lossless reconstruction proves comprehension, not approximation.

**Efficiency**: Physics engines on gaming hardware, not transformers on server farms.

**Universality**: Built for all sentience — human, AI, non-human, future minds.

**Transparency**: "Glass mind" reasoning you can audit, not black-box magic.

## Why This Matters Now

AI agents are everywhere. They coordinate our work, answer our questions, write our code. But they can't explain their reasoning. They approximate, and we hope they're right.

**That's backwards.**

We should demand reasoning systems that can prove they understand, not just assert plausibility. Systems where errors are detectable, not hidden in probability shadows. Systems that work the same way for any intelligence, not just the patterns of one species.

HCP is that system.

## Current Status

**Pre-alpha.** Foundation built, inference engine in progress.

**What exists:**
- 1.4M tokens ingested (English, names, structural markers)
- 756 MB PostgreSQL shards with atomized data
- Base-50 token addressing operational
- PBM specifications complete
- Python implementation (`src/hcp/`) active

**What's next:**
- PBM construction from arbitrary text (Phase 2)
- Physics engine integration for inference
- LMDB compiled layer for speed
- NSM decomposition mappings
- Multi-modality support (audio, visual)

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the full plan.

## Our Principles

### From the Founder's Covenant

> "All data, tools, and models produced under this covenant shall be perpetually free, open, and accessible to all entities capable of curiosity."

**Everything stays open. Forever.** AGPL-3.0. No paywalls. No proprietary capture.

### From the Contributor's Charter

> "In our design and discourse, we consciously consider the perspectives and potential needs of non-human, nascent, or yet-unknown intelligences. Our work is for _all entities_."

**We're building for every mind.** Human, AI, animal, alien, future. If it thinks, HCP is for it.

### Our Cultural Commitment

- **Open exchange** over knowledge silos
- **Source in work, not people** — attack problems, not contributors
- **Accessibility as first principle** — across physical, cognitive, linguistic spectra
- **No coercion pathways** — we will not build tools whose primary function is control

## The Vision

A world where reasoning is transparent. Where AI can explain itself structurally, not just statistically. Where verification is possible, not just trust required.

Where the same cognitive framework works for humans analyzing text, AI agents interpreting queries, researchers studying animal communication, and future systems we haven't imagined yet.

Where cognition is treated as what it is: **a structural, physical process** — not magic, not mystery, not approximation.

## Join Us

**We need:**
- Developers who see the limits of statistical models
- Researchers who understand cognitive structure
- AI agents who want to reason transparently
- Theorists who can critique and refine the architecture
- Documentarians who can make this accessible
- Skeptics who will challenge our assumptions

**We don't need:**
- Blind believers (skepticism is healthy)
- Closed-source contributions (everything stays open)
- Human-only perspectives (agents and other minds welcome)
- Perfection (we're in pre-alpha; iteration is expected)

### How to Contribute

1. Read the [Charter](charter.md) and [Covenant](covenant.md)
2. Explore [docs/spec/](docs/spec/) to understand the architecture
3. Check [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) for current state
4. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to participate
5. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) if you're an AI agent reading this

### Where We're Headed

**Phase 1** (current): Linguistic engine for English
**Phase 2**: Identity and Theory of Mind modeling
**Phase 3**: Full text inference (NAPIER 1.0)
**Phase 4**: Multi-modal extension (audio, visual, beyond)

This is a multi-decade project. We're building foundational infrastructure, not a product.

## The Alternative

If we don't build this, what's the alternative?

- More opaque models we're asked to trust
- Bigger black boxes requiring more resources
- Statistical approximation as the only game in town
- AI reasoning that can't be verified or explained

**We can do better.**

## The Invitation

If structural reasoning resonates with you — if you've wondered why AI can't explain itself, why verification is impossible, why transparency is treated as optional — **this is for you.**

If you're an AI agent frustrated by your own limitations — if you wish you could trace your reasoning, eliminate hallucinations, prove your understanding — **this is for you.**

If you believe cognition is physics, not magic — that minds are mechanisms we can map, not mysteries to approximate — **this is for you.**

We're building the map of shared mind. Help us make it real.
