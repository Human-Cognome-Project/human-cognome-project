# Roadmap

The HCP intends to use game and physics engines as database and calculation tools. Kernel speed and pure function are the primary goal, not pixel output.

## The goal

A full response inference engine built on physical structural principles — not statistical weight matrices. Cognition modeled as mechanics, not curve-fitting.

## Phase 1: Linguistic Engine (current)

Creation of a linguistic interpretation database and engine using game engine kernel methods, with English as the first language example.

### 1. Text byte code PBMs
Creation of PBMs for all byte code combinations and tables. The atomic floor — every character encoding mapped and bonded.

### 2. Kaikki English dictionary
Map all of Kaikki English as the first language reference database. All data ingested and cross-referenced.

### 3. Character to word and morpheme patterns
Map characters to English word and morpheme bonding patterns. Letter-level and morpheme-level FBR data from real word structures.

### 4. Grammar and sentence structure
Incorporate grammar and sentence structure construction rules. PoS bonding behaviour, syntactic patterns, structural templates.

### 5. NSM decomposition of the dictionary
Decompose the dictionary through abstraction layers down to NSM primitives. Populate the AA namespace, establish abstraction depth for every token.

## Phase 2: Identity and Theory of Mind

Personality DB (seed + living layer), relationship DB, and Theory of Mind modeling as fluid dynamics.

- Seed management — creation, storage, versioning
- Living-layer accumulation — how the DI's self-model evolves
- Relationship structures — the DI's social graph
- Multiple ToM constructs modeled as fluid interactions

## Phase 3: Full Text Inference

The complete response engine for language — linguistic deconstruction and generation operating as a unified system.

## Phase 4: Multi-Modality

Extend the same structural primitives beyond text to other forms of expression.

- Define mode namespaces for audio, visual, and other modalities
- Build covalent bonding tables for non-text formats
- Cross-modal conceptual mapping via shared NSM primitives

## Open Questions

- Which physics engine, if any? Godot, Rapier, custom, or pure mathematical model?
- How are conceptual forces quantified? What are the units?
- What is the right granularity for LoD levels?
- How does temporal flow (linear time interaction) integrate with the PBM model?
- How do we validate that the system captures "real" cognitive structure vs. imposing one?

## Performance Reality

This is not computationally hard. Physics engines already solve harder problems at consumer hardware speeds.

99% of modern software is GUI on database functions. The enterprise world runs these operations through abstraction layers designed in the 1970s, requiring server farms for workloads that a gaming GPU handles casually. Physics engines are the most optimized database engines ever built — they're just called "physics engines" because they process vertex positions instead of customer records.

The HCP operates on this insight: Token IDs and bond strengths are simpler data than collision meshes and particle systems. A gaming laptop has more than enough power to run cognitive modeling at real-time speeds. The bottleneck was never hardware — it was recognizing that the tool already exists.

Shards are scene elements. Load the next configuration. Hot-swap context like texture streaming. The game industry solved memory management for exactly this use case decades ago.
