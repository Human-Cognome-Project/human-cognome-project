# data model

Read before changing addressing, structural definitions, linguistic identities, LoD or geometry. Data writes require the owning accepted data contract.

## Addressing

`00` is common computational core; `02` is shared multilingual Linguistics;
`02.FS.LR.00.*` is reserved for language-frame word components. The old English
`01` / common `01.00` layout is superseded; no new meaning is assigned to `01`.
The #132 seed map is accepted; further allocations require review.
`y*` personal and `z*` temporary are first-symbol prefix families, not stored
wildcards or concrete object allocations. Concrete bindings need authorization;
internal subdivision, delegation, lifetime and expansion blocks remain deferred.


## Model contract

Follow the [conversion and continuation plan](../../docs/model-realignment-plan.md)
for sequencing, dependencies and verification. Its dated decisions supersede
conflicting historical model requirements; code still determines what is built.

- Primary SNode structure expresses conceptual LoD. Attached secondary
  compression structures inherit that scale at **1:1**, including nested
  dedupe; storage depth alone never creates a conceptual scale step.
- Component-derived spherical extent replaces universal fixed diameter.
  Supplied-layout enclosure is built; packing and broader extent questions remain open (#120).
- Parent response is proportional and whole-particle. No internal application
  offsets, rotation, rotary alignment or beads-on-string requirement.
- Corona-disabled variable-radius contact is built in the bounded object-support
  slice. Scaled attraction supplies intended cohesion; broader calibration
  remains empirical.
- Whitespace is recorded as positional gaps; optional model separators have
  only local connecting participation, no structural relationships or gathering
  mass, and no field with other whitespace occurrences.
- Track bridge/identity in #106, distance calibration in #115, whitespace in
  #116, response in #118, contact in #119 and extent in #120.
- Dictionary structures and SNode assembly are the near-term objective.
  Follow the [language component plan](../../docs/language-component-unicode-plan.md):
  `00` is the common computational core; `02` is the shared multilingual
  Linguistics base, with `02.FS.LR.00.*` reserved for language-frame word
  components. Patrick confirmed this supersedes English `01` / common `01.00`
  on 2026-10-11. No new meaning for `01` is assigned here. Formal cross-store
  writes still require the plan's bounded reference/write implementation.
- Linguistic aggregation uses reciprocal `members` / `member_of` links.
  Shared core character values retain one identity. Each language's letter or
  punctuation endpoint has its own linguistic identity, with ordered core
  character parents and matching additions to those core endpoints' child
  listings (Patrick clarified 2026-10-12). The linguistic endpoints join their
  language and alphabet/punctuation groupings. English variants belong to English, which
  belongs to its broader groups. Each grouping has its own centroid
  representation; alphabet and punctuation groups are distinct. Literal
  `parent` / `child` links describe construction only. Do not duplicate the
  underlying core character values or encode group containment as parents.
  Existing record-integrity findings are not cleared by
  documentation merges; check current PR/issue state before execution.
